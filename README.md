# Automatic-mobile-robot-Used-for-strawberry-harvesting
My work involves building an autonomous mobile car robot. Used for picking strawberries. which uses a closed work area such as a plant factory or small garden that wants to develop technology to improve the harvesting of produce
* Before you start I recommend that you research the scope of your strawberry picker robot project or the objects you need to move. You should study the movement, type of wheels, type of robot, and how the robot works. Work control orders, ROS and research related to your work. My scope of work involves a strawberry picking robot.
